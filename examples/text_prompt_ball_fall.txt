in the referenced image an orange ping pong ball is seen suspended mid-air during free fall within an indoor laboratory setting. generate a realistic video sequence that captures the following seuqnce action. the ball continues its free fall towards the lab table. impacts the surface of the table, and then bounces upward naturally, following the principles of physics. ensure the bounce height, speed, and motion are consistent with a typical ping pong ball. the lab environment should remain visible throughout, providing a stable backdrop, with appropriate indoor lighting and realistic shadows during the ballâ€™s descent and bounce.
